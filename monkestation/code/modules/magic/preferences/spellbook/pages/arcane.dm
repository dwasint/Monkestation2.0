		Mage Hand is a simple spell that allows the caster to manipulate an item from a distance. \
		The spell is often used to retrieve items that are out of reach, play pranks on unsuspecting victims, \
		press some buttons on a distant keyboard, or to simply avoid having to get up from a comfortable chair.\n\
		Due to its simplicity, the spell is often taught to the young as a first spell - and due to this commonality, \
		it is very easily recognized by most."
